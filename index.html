            Hi There! I'm a Nigerian web developer that has a strong love for
            coding. I think what makes programming so appealing is that no
            matter how much you think you understand a topic, there's always
            something new to learn. I have a hidden curiosity that has surfaced
            as a result of this ongoing learning process. Coding has turned into
            the driving force behind my never-ending quest to learn and
            comprehend new ideas every day.
